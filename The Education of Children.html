studies. For fyrst, the beginninges of learning, stãd specially by
memorie, which as I sayd, in yõg ones is very holdfast. Secondly because
nature hath made vs to knowledge the study of y<sup>t</sup> thynge can
not be to hasty, wherof y<sup>e</sup> author of al thyng her self hath

both much more quickly, &amp; also more esily thẽ doth y<sup>e</sup>
elder, as y<sup>e</sup> first beginnings of letters, y<sup>e</sup>
knowledge of tõges, tales &amp; fabels of poetes. Finallye, why shulde
y<sup>t</sup> age be thought vnmete to lerning, which is apt to lerne
maners? Or what other thinge shuld chyldrẽ do rather whẽ they be more
able to speake, seyng nedes thei muste do sumwhat? How much more profite

<span class="folionum">G.ii.</span>
<!-- png 099 -->
so litle, yet a lucre, dispised of purpose? Now if you oftẽ put a lytle
to a litle, there riseth a greate heape. Herewith cõsider this also, if
beyng an infant he lerne smaller thinges, he shalt lerne greter,
growynge vpwardes in those yeres, in which those smaller shuld haue ben
lerned. Finally whyle he doth these thinges, at y<sup>e</sup> least he
shal be kept frõ those fautes, wherw<sup>t</sup> we se comẽly
y<sup>t</sup> age to be infected. For nothynge doth better occupy
y<sup>e</sup> whole mynd of man, thẽ studies. Verely this lucre ought
not to be set light bi. But if we shuld graũte that by these labours
y<sup>e</sup> strength of y<sup>e</sup> body is sumwhat diminished; yet
thinke I this losse well recõpensed by winnynge of wyt. For the minde by
moderate labours is made more quicke, &amp; lustye. And if ther be any
ieopardy in this pointe, it may be auoyded by our diligẽce. You must
haue for this tender age a teacher to enter it by fayre meanes, &amp;
not discorage it by foule. And ther be also some things both plesaũt to
be knowen, &amp; as it wer sibbe to childrẽs wittes, whiche to lerne is
rather a play thẽ a labour. Howbeit childehod is not so

baren olde age is, and further how few come vnto it, thou wylt not

<h4>The selfe same matter enlarged by copye.</h4>

<p>After the longe despayred fruitfulnes of thy wyfe, I&nbsp;hearsay
thou art made a father, and that wyth a man chylde, whyche sheweth in it
selfe a meruelous towardnes, and euen to be lyke the parentes: and that
if so be we maye by such markes
<span class="folionum">G.iii.</span>

and tokens pronosticate anye thyng, maye seeme to promise perfite
vertue. And that therfore thou doest entend, to se thys chylde of so
grete hope, assone as he shalbe somewhat of age to be begonne in good
letters, and to be taught in very honest learnynge, to be instructed and
fashioned with the very wholsome preceptes of philosophy. In deede you
wyll be the whole father, and you wyll haue hym your very son, and to
loke lyke you, not only in the fashion of hys face, and liniamẽtes of
hys bodye, but also in the giftes of hys wytte. Verely as I am hertelye
glad for the good fortune of myne especiall friende, so I greatlye alowe
your wyse entente. This one thynge I wolde warne you of boldlye in
deede, but louinglye, not to suffer after the iudgemente and example of
the cõmon people, that the fyrst age of your infante shulde flytte awaye
without all fruite of good instrucciõ, and then at the last to set hym
to learne hys fyrste letters, when bothe hys age wyll not so well be
handled, and hys wytte
<span class="folionum">||</span>
<!-- png 102 -->
shall be more readye to euyll, and peraduenture possessed alreadye
w<sup>t</sup> the fast holdyng bryers of vices. ¶&nbsp;Yea rather euẽ
now loke about for some man, as of maners pure &amp; vncorrupt, so also
wel learned: &amp; into his lap deliuer your litle chyld, as it wer to a
nurse of hys tẽder mind, that euẽ w<sup>t</sup> his milke he may sucke
in swete lerning: &amp; deuide the care of thy litle sõne to his nurses
&amp; teacher that they shuld suckun the litle body w<sup>t</sup> very
good iuyce, &amp; so indue hys mynd w<sup>t</sup> very wholsom opinions,
&amp; very honest lernynge. For I thinke it not conuenient that
y<sup>u</sup> one of al the best learned, &amp; also wysest shuldest
geue care to those piuyshe women, or vnto mẽ very lyke to thẽ the beard
excepted, whych by a cruell pytie, &amp; hateful loue, iudge that the
chyldren euen vntyl they waxe springoldes, shuld be kept at home kyssyng
theyr mothers, and among the sweete wordes of theyr nurses pastymes, and
vnchaste trystynges of seruauntes and maydens. And thynke that they
ought vtterlye to be kepte awaye from learnyng as
<span class="folionum">G.iiii.</span>
<!-- png 103 -->
from venome, saying that the fyrst age is so rude that it can receiue no
discipline, and so tender that it is not mete for the labours of
studies: and finally that the profite of that age is so lytle worth,
that neyther anye coste shulde be made vpon it, neyther y<sup>t</sup>
the weakenes of the chyldrẽ shuld be vexed. Whyle I proue euery of these
thynges false, I&nbsp;pray you a lytle whyle take hede, countyng as the
truth is, fyrst that these thynges be writtẽ of him which loueth you as
wel as any mã doth, &amp; inespecially of y<sup>t</sup> thing which so
perteineth to you, y<sup>t</sup> none can do more. <!-- newline --> For
what is more derer to you thẽ your son, inespecial hauing but him alone,
vpon whõ we wold be glad if we might bestowe yea our life, not only our
substaũce. Wherfore who mai not se y<sup>t</sup> thei do leudly &amp;
also vntowardli which in tilling their lãd building their houses, keping
their horse, vse y<sup>e</sup> gretest diligẽce thei cã, &amp; take to
counsell men y<sup>t</sup> be wyse, &amp; of great experience: in
bringing vp and teachynge theyr chyldren, for whose sakes al other
thinges ar gotten, take so litle regard that nether
<span class="folionum">||</span>
<!-- png 104 -->
they once councel with theyr owne mynd, not seke for the iudgements of
wyse men, but as thoughe there were a trifle in hande, geue care to
folyshe women, and to euery rascal wretche, whych is no lesse shame to
hear, then if a man taking thought for the shooe, wolde set naught by
the foote, or wyth great study wold prouide that there shuld be no faut
in the garmente, naught reckynge for the healthe of the bodye. Good syr,
I&nbsp;wyl not here cause you to tarye wyth common places, howe muche
the strength of nature, how much fatherly loue, the law of god, mens
consti­tucions require the parentes to owe vnto the childrẽ, thorowe
whom asmuche as we maye wee escape to dye, and be made to lyue euer. But
some thynke they haue gaylye done the office of a father, when they haue
only begottẽ chyldren, where as thys is the least porcion of loue that
the name of a father requyreth. What greate thought take the mothers
comenlye leste the infant shulde loke a gogle or a squint, lest he shuld
be puffe
<span class="folionum">||</span>
<!-- png 105 -->
cheked, wrie necked, croke shuldred, croke legged, splaye footed, and
lest that the proporcion of his bodye shuld not be trimme in euery
point: whereunto besyde other thynges, they be wont to vse swadelbondes,
and keepe in their chekes wyth lytle miters. They haue regard also to
theyr mylke, their meate, theyr bathes, &amp; their mouinges, by whyche
thynges the phisicions in many bookes, and inespeciall Galene hath
taught that the chyldren get good healthe of theyr bodye: neyther do
they differ thys diligẽce vnto the seuenth or tenth yere, but euẽ assone
as the chylde commeth oute of the mothers wombe, they take greate charge
of thys. And they do well, for the infancie not regarded, oftentymes
causeth men to haue a syckely and sore disseased olde age, if they
happen to come to it. Yea moreouer or euer the chyld be born, yet dothe
the mother take great heede: Thei eate not of euery meat when they be
greate with chylde, they take heede that they moue not theyr bodie to
hurte them: and if
<span class="folionum">||</span>
<!-- png 106 -->
there happen any thyng to fall vpon their face, by and by they take it
away wyth theyr hand, and laye it vpon the priuie part of theyr body.
<!-- newline --> It hath ben proued by many experimentes, that by this
remedie the deformitie whych wold haue bene on that part of
y<sup>e</sup> body that is sene, hathe lyen hyd in the secrete place.
<!-- newline --> No mã calleth this to hasty a care whych is vsed for
the worser parte of man. Why then is that parte of man, wherby we be
properly called menne, neglected so many yeres? ¶&nbsp;Shuld he not do
all agaynste gods forbod which wold trim his cap, lettyng his head be
vnkempt, and all scabbed? Yet much more vnreasonable is it that we shuld
bestow iuste labours vpon the mortall bodye, and to haue no regarde of
the immortal soule. Further, if a mã haue at home an horse colte, or a
whelpe of a good kynd, wyl he not straight waye begynne to fashion hym
to do sumwhat, and wyll do that so muche the more gladlye, the readyer
the yonge age is to folow the teachers mynde? Wee wyl teache

the elder he waxeth, the lesse apte he wyll be to be taughte, yea the
common prouerbe geuyng warnynge of thys thynge: That an old popiniaye
careth not for the rod. ¶&nbsp;And what a thynge is it to be diligente
in a byrde, and slowe in teachynge thy sonne? What do the wytty
husbandmen? Do they not teach euen straight way the plãtes whyle they be
yet tender, to put awaye theyr wylde nature by graffynge, and wyll not
tarye tyll they be waxen bygge and myghtye? ¶&nbsp;And they do not onlye
take heede that the litle tree grow not croked or haue any other faute,
but if ther be anye, they make haste to amend it, whyle it wyll yet
bowe, and folowe the hande of the fashioner. ¶&nbsp;And what liuyng
thynge, or what plante wyll bee as the owener <ins class="correction" title="text reads ‘or or’">or</ins> housebande manne wolde haue it to

¶ In dede to manye dumme beastes, nature the mother of all thynges, hath
geuen more helpe to do theyr natural offices, but because the prouidẽce
of God hath of al creatures vnto men onlye geuen the strength of reason,
she hath left the greatest parte to educacion, in so much that one hath
written very wel the first poynte, the middle, and the thirde, that is
the chyefe of all mans felicitye, to be good instruccion, &amp; ryght
bryngynge vp. Whych prayse Demosthenes gaue to ryght pronun­ciacion,
and that in deede not falsely, but ryghte bryngynge vp helpeth muche
more to wysedome, then pronun­ciation to eloquence. For diligente
and holy bringing vp, is the founteyne of al vertue. As to folye and
myschief, the fyrst, seconde, and thyrde poynte, is vndiligente and
corrupte educacion. Thys is the thynge that is chiefelye lefte vnto vs.
That is the cause why vnto other beastes nature hathe geuen swyftnes,
flyght, sharpnes of sight, greatnes, and strengthe of bodye, scales,
flyshes, heares, hornes, nayles,
<span class="folionum">||</span>
<!-- png 109 -->
venome, wherby they may both defende their healthe, and prouide for
theyr liuynge, and brynge vp their yonge: and bryngeth forthe man onlye
softe, naked, and vnfensed: but in stede of all thys, hath geuen hym a
mynde hable to receiue all discipline, because in this onlye are all
thynges, if a man wyll exercise it. And euerye liuynge thynge, the lesse
mete it is to teachynge, so muche the more it hathe of natiue prudence.
Bees learne not to make their celles, to gather iuce, and to make honye.
The Emets are not taughte to gather into their holes in somer, wherby
they shulde lyue in wynter, but all these thynges be done by instruccion
of nature. But man neyther can eate, nor go, nor speake, except he be
taught. Then if the tree brynge forthe eyther no fruite or vnsauerye,
without the diligence of graffing, if the dogge be vnmete to hunte, the
horse vnapte to iuste, the oxe to the plowe, except oure diligence bee
putte to, howe wylde and vnprofitable a creature wolde man become,
except diligẽtlye,
<span class="folionum">||</span>
<!-- png 110 -->
and in dewe tyme he shulde be fashioned by good bryngynge vp.
¶&nbsp;I&nbsp;wyll not here rehearse vnto you the example of Lycurgus
knowen of euerye man, whyche bryngynge oute two whelpes, one of a gentle
kynde, but euyll taughte, that ran to the meate, that other of sluggyshe
syres, but diligently brought vp, that leafte the meate and leapt vpon
the beast. Nature is an effectuall thynge, but educacion more
effectuall, ouercommeth it. Menne take heede that they maye haue a good
dog to hunte, to haue a good horse to iournei with, and here thei thynke
no diligence to be to hastie, but to haue a sonne that shulde be both
worship and profite to the parentes, vpon whome they myghte laye a good
part of the charges of their houshold, whose loue mighte noryshe and
beare vp their vnweldy age, and y<sup>t</sup> shuld shew hym self a
trustye and healpynge sonne in a lawe, a&nbsp;good husbande to his wife,
a&nbsp;valiaunte and profitable citizen to the common wealthe,
I&nbsp;saye to haue suche one, eyther they take no
<span class="folionum">||</span>
<!-- png 111 -->
care, or else they care to late. For whõ do they plant? for whõ do they
plowe? for whõ do they buylde? for whõ do they hunt for riches both by
land &amp; by sea? not for theyr chyldrẽ? <!-- newline --> But what
profite or worshyp is in these thinges, if he y<sup>t</sup> shal be

gotten, but of the possessor we take no kepe Who prepareth an harpe for
the vnskylfull of musycke? Who garnysheth a librarie for hym that can
skyl of no bookes? And are so great ryches gotten for hym whyche can not
tell howe to vse them? If thou gettest these thynges to hym that is well
broughte vp, thou geueste hym instrumentes of vertue: but if thou get
them for a rude and rusticall wytte, what other thynge doest thou then
minister a matter of wantonnesse and mischiefe? What canne bee thoughte
more folyshe then thys kynde of fathers? They prouide that the bodie of
the sonne maye be wythout faute, and shulde bee made apte to do all
manner thynges comelye, but the mynde,
<span class="folionum">||</span>
<!-- png 112 -->
by whose moderacion all honeste wyrkes do stand, that they care not for.
It nedeth me not here to rehearse that riches, dignitie, authoritie, and
also healthfulnes of body, whych menne so desirouslye wyshe to theyr
chyldren, nothynge doth more get them vnto man, thẽ vertue and
learninge. They wyshe vnto them a praye, but they wyll not geue thẽ a
nette to take it with all. That thing which is of al most excellent,
thou canst not geue thy sonne, but thou mayest store hym wyth those good
sciences, wherby the best thynges be gotten. Now is this a great
incon­uenience, but it is yet a greater, that they leaue at home
their dogge wel taught, their horse well broken and taught, and theyr
son enstructed wyth no learnyng. They haue land well tylled, and theyr
sonne shamefull rude. ¶&nbsp;They haue their house goodly trimmed, and
theyr sonne voyde of all garnyshyng. Further, they whych after the
peoples estimacion seme to be meruelouse wyse, do prolong the diligence
to garnyshe the mind
<span class="folionum">H.i.</span>
<!-- png 113 -->
eyther in to an age vnapte to bee taughte, or else take no care at all
for it, and are meruelouse thoughtfull of externall goodes of fortune,
yea or euer he be borne, whom they haue appoynted to be lorde of thẽ
all. For what se we not them to do? <!-- newline --> When their wyfe is
greate with chylde, then call they for a searcher of natiuities, the

the chylde shulde be fortunate in warre: wee wyll, saye they, dedicate
this chyld to the kynges courte. If he shal promyse ecclesi­asticall
dygnitie, wee wyll, saye they, hunte for hym by some meanes,
a&nbsp;Byshoprycke, or a fatte Abbotshyp. Thys chylde wyl we make a
president or a deane. ¶&nbsp;Thys semeth not to them to hasty a care
when they preuente euen the wery byrth: and semeth it to hastye that is
vsed in fashioning your childrens myndes? So quyclye you prouide to haue

common wealth? Before the tyme come you go aboute this, to haue your
sonne a byshop, or an abbot, and wylt thou not fashion hym to this well,
to beare the office of a byshop, or an abbot? Thou setteste hym to a
chariot, and shewest hym not the manner to guyde it. Thou puttest hym to
the sterne, and passest not that he shulde learne those thynges that
becommeth a shypmaster to know. Finally in all thy possessions thou
regardest nothing lesse then that, that is moste precious, &amp; for
whose sake al other thynges be gotten. Thi corne fieldes be goodly, thy
houses be fayre, thy vessel is bright, thy garmentes, and al thy
housholde stuffe, thy horses bee wel kept, thi seruaũtes wel taught,
only thy sonnes wyt is foule, filthy &amp; all sluttishe. Thou hast
perchaũce bought by the drũme a bond slaue, vyle, and barbarous, if he
be rude and ignoraunt, y<sup>u</sup> markest to what vse he is good,

Apuleus wrote to haue happened to hym selfe, and Austin also hathe

called the father of such a monster. But it is a more merueylous monster
that a beastes mynde shulde be in a mans bodye, and yet do very many

whether he wold haue hys onlye sonne dead to wynne an hundred horses, if

in thys poynt to be thryfty, is no sparynge but a madnes. There be other
agayn that take good heede in chosyng a master, but that is at the
desyre of their friendes. They lette passe a meete and cunninge man to
teache chyldren, and take one that can no skyll, for none other cause,

whether wilt thou sende for a leche at the good word of thy friend, or
for his cũning in lechcraft. What? Is thy sonne of lesse price vnto the

This beyng a foule thynge in meane citizens, how much more shamefull is
it in great menne? At one supper a dashynge agaynst the mischeuous rocke

y<sup>e</sup> offices of Cicero, or the Ethickes of Aristotle, or the
moral bokes of Seneca or Plutarche, or the epistles of Paule,
I&nbsp;confesse, but yet if he do any thyng vncomly at the table, he is
monyshed, and when he is monyshed, he fashioneth hym selfe to do as he
is taught. He is brought into the temple, he lerneth to bowe his kne, to
holde hys handes manerly, to put of hys cap, and to fashion all the
behaueour of hys bodie to worshyp God, he is
<span class="folionum">||</span>
<!-- png 155 -->
cõmaunded to holde hys peace when misteries be in doyng, and to turne
hys eyes to the alter. These rudimentes of modestye and vertue the
childe lerneth before he can speake, which because they sticke fast
vntil he be elder, they profit somwhat to true religiõ. There is no
differẽce to a chyld when he is first borne, betwene his parẽntes &amp;
straungers. Anon after he learneth to knowe his mother, &amp; after his
father. He learneth by litle &amp; litle to reuerẽce thẽ, he learneth to
obey them, &amp; to loue thẽ. He vnlerneth to be angrye, to be auẽged,
&amp; when he is biddẽ kysse thẽ that he is ãgry withal, he doth it,
&amp; vnlerneth to bable out of measure. He lerneth to rise vp, &amp;
geue reuerence to an old mã, &amp; to put of his cap at y<sup>e</sup>
image of the crucifix. Thei that thinke y<sup>t</sup> these lytle
rudimẽtes help nothing to vertue, in my mind be greatly deceiued,
A&nbsp;certẽ yonge man whẽ he was rebuked of Plato because he had plaied

that is prynted in it: the waxe may be so softe that nothynge can bee

receyue learnyng. No age sayth Seneca, is to late to learne: whether
that be true or no I wot not, surely elderly age is very harde to learne
some thyngs. This is doutles, that no age is so yonge but it is apte to
be taught, inespecially those thynges vnto the whych nature hathe made

desyre of folowyng, that what so euer they haue herde or seene, they
desyre to do the lyke, and reioyse when they thynke they can do any
thyng: a&nbsp;man wolde saye they wer apes. And of thys ryseth the
fyrste coniecture of their wyt and aptnes to be taughte. Therefore
assone as the man chyld is borne, anone he is apte to lerne maners.
After whẽ he hath begon to speake, he is mete to be taught letters. Of

to speake playnly and wythout faute, in this afore tyme the nourses and

whome the common people thynketh not sufficiente ynoughe to teache a
grammer schole. And thei thynkyng they haue gotten a kingdome, it is
marueyle to see howe they set vp the brystels because thei haue rule,
not vpon beastes, as sayeth Terence, but vpõ that age whiche ought to be
cheryshed wyth all gentlenes. You wolde saye it were not a schole, but a
tormentynge place: nothynge is hearde there beside the flappynge vpon
the hande, beside yorkynge of roddes, besyde howlynge and sobbinge and
cruell threatnynges. What other thynge maye chyldren learne hereof, then
to hate learnyng? When this hatered hath once setteled in the tender

more foolyshe, that some men sende their lytle chyldren to a pyuyshe
dronken woman to learne to reade and wryte. It is agaynste nature that
women shulde haue rule vpon menne: besyde that, nothynge is more cruell
then that kynde, if they bee moued with anger, as it wyll soone be, and
wyll not cease tyll it be full reuenged. Monasteries also, and colleges
of brethern, for so they cal them selues, seeke for their liuynge

¶&nbsp;Thys kynde of teachynge howe so euer other menne alowe it, by my
counsell no manne shall vse it, who soeuer entendeth to haue hys child
well brought vp. It behoueth that eyther there were no schole, or else

¶&nbsp;But it is no great thynge to beare rule vpon Asses or Swyne, but

gentle monicions you may leade whither ye wyll. Truth it is that of thys
disposicion I my selfe was when I was a childe, and when my master whych
loued me aboue all other, because he sayd he conceiued a certen great
hope of me, toke more heede, watched me well, and at laste to proue howe
I could abyde the rod, and laying a faute vnto my charge which I neuer
thought of, did beat me, that thinge so put awaye from me all the loue
of studie, and so discouraged my chyldyshe mynd, that for sorowe I hadde
almost consumed awaye, and in deede folowed therof a quartaine ague.
When at laste he had perceiued hys faute, among his friendes he bewailed
it. ¶&nbsp;This wyt (quod he) I&nbsp;had almoste destroyed before I
knewe it. For he
<span class="folionum">||</span>

was a man both wyttye and well learned, and as I thynke, a&nbsp;good mã.
He repẽted him, but to late for my parte. Here nowe (good syr) cõiecture
me howe many frowarde wyttes these vnlerned greate beaters do destroye,
yet proud in their owne conceite of learnyng, wayeward, dronken, cruel,
and that wyl beate for their pleasure: them selues of suche a cruell
nature, that they take plesure of other mens tormentes. These kynde of
men shuld haue ben bouchers or hangmẽ, not teachers of youth. Neyther do
any torment chyldren more cruelly, thẽ they that canne not teache them.
¶&nbsp;What shulde thei do in scholes but passe the daye in chydyng and
beatynge? I&nbsp;knewe a diuine and that familierly, a&nbsp;man of

they shuld be accustumed to stripes. I&nbsp;my selfe on a time stode
nerre hym, when after diner he called out a boie as he was wõt to do, as
I trow ten yere olde. And he was but newe come frome hys mother into

hys mother, and was earnestly committed of her vnto hym: anon to haue an
occacion to beate hym, he beganne to laye to hys charge I wotte not what

beckened to hym to whome he committed the chyefe rule of hys colledge,

haue them fre men, how shameful is it bi bryngyng vp, to make seruantes

betwixte a master and a father. The master only compelleth, the father
by honestie and gentelnes accustumeth hys sonne, to do well of hys owne

<span class="sidenote">
The practise of a certen englishe man to teache hys chyld hys letters by
shootyng.</span>
The englyshe mẽ delyte principally in shotynge, and teache it their
chyldren fyrst of all: wherefore a certen father that had a good quicke
wyt perceiuinge his sonne to haue a greate pleasure in shotyng, bought
hym a prety bowe &amp; very fayr arrowes, &amp; in al partes both of hys
bowe &amp; arrowes were letters painted. Afterwards insted of markes, he
set vp the fashiõ of leters, fyrste of Greke, and after of latẽ: when he
hyt, &amp; tolde the name of the letter, besyde a greate reioysinge, he
had for a reward a cherye, or some other thynge that chyldrẽ delyte in.
Of that playe commeth more fruite, if two or thre matches playe
together. For then the hope of victorie and feare of rebuke maketh them
to take more heede, and to be more chereful. By thys deuise it was
broughte aboute that the

whych drawe out these thyngs by playinge at chesses or dyce. For when
the playes them selues passe the capacitie of chyldren, how shal they
lerne the letters by them? ¶&nbsp;This is not to helpe the chyldrens
wyttes, but to put one labour to an other. As there be certen engins so
full of worke and so curious, that they hynder the doynge of the
busines. Of thys sorte commonly be all those thynges whych some haue
deuised of the arte of memorye for to gette money, or for a vayne

lytle, that it is not worthe the laboure, eyther to take so muche payne
in teachynge, or bestowe so much coste. And these in dede seme vnto me,
not so muche to care for to profite the chyldren, as for the sparyng of
theyr money, or the teachers labour. But I wyl saye he is no father,
whyche when the matter is of teaching his child, taketh so greate care
for expenses. <!-- newline --> Also it is a folyshe pitie, to thintent

Let vs graunt that it is but a very lytle, yet were it better the chylde
to do it, then eyther nothyng at al, or lerne somewhat that after muste

sone as he beginneth to speake, whiche in no wyse can be vnoccupied?
<!-- newline --> Also how lytle soeuer it be that the former age doth
bringe, yet shal the chylde lerne greater thynges, euen in the same
yeres, when smaller shuld haue ben lerned, if he had not lerned them
before. Thys sayth Fabius, euery yere furthered and increased profiteth
to a great summe and as much tyme as is taken before in the infancie, is
gotten to the elder age. It nedeth not to rehearse that in those first
yeres certen thinges be easely lerned, which be more hard to be lerned
whẽ we be elder. <!-- newline --> For it is very easely lerned, that is
lerned in time conueniente. Let vs graunt that they be small and litle

A&nbsp;diligente marchaunt setteth not light bi winning of a farthing,

losse of tyme may by no meanes be recouered. Beside this the fyrst part
of our lyfe is coũted to be best, and therfore shuld be bestowed more
warelye. Hesiodus aloweth not sparynge, neyther at the hyest, nor at the
lowest, because when the tunne is full it semeth to hasty, and to late
when it is spente: and therefore byddeth vs spare in the myddes. But of
tyme we muste nowher cast away the sparing, and if we shuld spare when
the tunne is ful for thys cause that wyne is best in the myddest, then

<h4><a name="endnote" id="endnote">Notes on the Text</a></h4>

<h5>Paragraphs</h5>

<p>Some paragraph breaks in this e-text are conjectural. The printed
book had the following kinds of breaks:</p>

<div class="inset">
<p>conventional paragraph with indented first line</p>
<p>unambiguous paragraph with non-indented first line</p>
<p>ambiguous paragraph: previous line ends with blank space, but the
space is not large enough to contain the first syllable of the
following line</p>
<p>sentence break corresponds to line break: this happens randomly in
any printed book, and only becomes ambiguous when the book also has
non-indented paragraphs</p>
</div>

<p>In this e-text, the second type of paragraph is marked with a simple
line break (no space) and pilcrow&nbsp;¶. The third type has a pilcrow ¶
but no break. The fourth type is not marked.</p>

<h5>Spelling</h5>

<p>The pattern of initial <b>v</b>, non-initial <b>u</b> is followed
consistently.</p>
<p>The spelling “they” is more common than “thei”.</p>
<p>The form “then” is normally used for both “then” and “than”; “than”
is rare.</p>
<p>The most common spelling is “wyll”, but “wyl”, “wil” and “will” also
occur.</p>

<h5>Word Division</h5>

<p>Line-end hyphens were completely arbitrary; words split at line break
were hyphenated about two-thirds of the time. The presence or absence of
a hyphen has not been noted. Hyphenless words at line-end were joined or
separated depending on behavior elsewhere in the text:</p>

<div class="inset">
<p><i>Always one word</i> (re-joined at line break): som(e)what,
without, afterward(e)s</p>
<p><i>Usually one word:</i> often( )times, what( )so( )euer</p>
<p><i>One or two words:</i> an( )other</p>
<p><i>Usually two words:</i> it/him/my.. self/selues; shal(&nbsp;)be;
straight(&nbsp;)way</p>
<p><i>Always two words:</i> here to</p>
</div>

<h5>Roman Numerals</h5>

<p>Numbers were printed with leading and following .period. When the
number came at the beginning or end of a line, the “outer” period was
sometimes omitted. These have been supplied for consistency.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
